## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About `.env` Files

The `.env` file contains sensitive information and should **never** be committed to version control. We've included it in the `.gitignore` file, but always double-check that you don't accidentally commit it.

To ensure your `.env` file is not tracked:

```bash
git check-ignore -v .env
```

If you've accidentally committed it in the past, you can remove it from tracking:

```bash
git rm --cached .env
```
